# Main Application Configuration
# This is the default configuration file
# Environment-specific configs (application-dev.yaml, application-prod.yaml) override this

spring:
  application:
    name: skillbridge-backend
  
  # Active profile - change this to switch environments
  # Options: dev, local, prod
  profiles:
    active: local

# When 'dev' profile is active, Spring Boot will also load application-dev.yaml
# This allows us to have environment-specific settings
